<h1>Rearranging Nodes in the Tree</h1>

<p>To cut/copy a node:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Right-click the node</li>
	<li>left-click on either the cut or copy option from the menu</li>
</ol>

<p>
You can then pick a node, then right-click and bring up the menu again, and choose "Paste" or "Paste as Sibling".

<h3>Paste as a Child Node</h3>

<p>If after you use the cut or copy option, and you select the "Paste" option, the currently selected node will be the 
parent of the node.  For example, if the recently cut node was called "stuff" and the "paste" option was 
selected, stuff would appear under the "article".  "Article" would now become the parent of "stuff".</p>

<h3>Paste as a Sibling Node</h3>

<p>If after you use the cut or copy option, and you select the "Paste as Sibling"  option, the node will appear right
under the currently selected node.  For  example, if the recently cut node was called "stuff" and the "paste as Sibling"
option was selected, stuff would appear under the "article".  "Article" would now become a sibling of "stuff".</p>
