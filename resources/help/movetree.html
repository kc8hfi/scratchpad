            <li><big><big>The node will move up in the tree</big></big></li>
                   
</ol>
         There are 2 other ways to get to this command: <br>
                 
<ul>
           <li>click on the tools menu</li>
           <li>right-click on the node<br>
           </li>
                 
</ul>
         There are some basic rules to this particular command. &nbsp;The 
node   will   only move up if the parent is the same as the selected node. 
&nbsp;If   you   want to move the node out to another parent, or to another 
child, use  the   cut and paste features. &nbsp;See "<a href="#cutpaste">cut 
and paste</a>"    for information.<br>

           <li><big><big>Select a node to be moved down</big></big></li>
           <li><big><big>Click the "Move Node Down" toolbar icon.&nbsp;</big></big></li>
           <li><big><big>The node will move down in the tree</big></big></li>
                 
</ol>
         There are 2 other ways to get to this command: <br>
                   
<ul>
           <li>click on the tools menu</li>
           <li>right-click on the node<br>
            </li>
                 
</ul>
         As with the "Move selected Node Up" option, there are some rules 
to  this   command. &nbsp;The node will only move the node down if the parent
  node stays  the same as the selected node. &nbsp;If you want the node to
 be moved to a different location, see "<a
 href="file:///C:/scratchpad/converter/TESTING/movetree.html#cutpaste">cut 
    and paste</a>" for more information. &nbsp;<br>

<div align="left">To cut a node out of the tree:<br>

         <li><big>left-click the "cut" option from the menu</big></li>
             
</ol>
       You can then pick a node, then right-click and bring up the menu again,
   and choose "Paste as Child" or "Paste as Sibling". &nbsp;See <a
 href="#pastechildnode">"Paste As Child"</a> for more information. &nbsp;See 
   also "<a href="#pastesibling">Paste as sibling</a>". &nbsp;<br>

         <br>
         <br>
         If after you use the cut option, &nbsp;and you select the "Paste 
as  Child"  option, the currently selected node will be the parent of the 
node.  &nbsp;For  example, if the recently cut node was called "stuff" and 
the "paste  as child"  option was selected, stuff would appear under the "article".
&nbsp;"Article"   would now become the parent of "stuff".<br>

                If after you use the cut option, &nbsp;and you select the
"Paste as Sibling"  option, the node will appear right under the currently
selected node.  &nbsp;For  example, if the recently cut node was called "stuff"
and the "paste  as Sibling"  option was selected, stuff would appear under
the "article". &nbsp;"Article"   would now become a sibling of&nbsp; "stuff".<br>
